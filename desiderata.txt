Desiderata:
- Delete tags from a phrase on an individual level
- Ability to rename tags (combine add and delete process)
- Clicking any part of the phrase makes it selected
- Pressing tab when the tag popup is open shouldn't start playing the selected phrase
- Importing a text doesn't immediately add it to the corpus and rerender the texts list, but it should
- Ability to search within results
- Redisplay tagger after bulk tag
- Count of the number of items with each tag (overview view)
- Name of Add tag button in popup needs to change depending on whether you're adding or removing tags
- Tags overview list still isn't sorting correctly (you should just filter the tags into new arrays, and display only those arrays) in order
- Clicking on tag category renders all tags with that category (not just exact matches)
- Character palette
- Notes field on the tag
- Color field on tag
- Clicking the manage corpora box, then clicking outside of it, seems to reset the workview - stop this behavior
- Hide the results counter when the tagger module is hidden (it displays the last result when the user comes back to it)
- Ability to search for things that *don't* have a particular tag
- Pressing escape when a popup is open should close it
- Order the phrase-level tags alphabetically as well
- Ability to deselect all results
- Create .tagUp() and .tagDown() functions, to apply a tag at one level to every object at the level immediately above/below it
  - Maybe also a .moveTagDown() function, which moves a tag down a level to a specific, provided child
  - Also a .moveTagUp(), which moves a tag to its parent
- User icon should toggle the user popup, not just display it
- Add .selected highlighting to tags when clicked, and when ctrl+clicked (this probably means that the tagsOverview module shouldn't rerender for a new search - only when the corpus tag data changes)
- stick results / search bar at top
- a stats module
- the User popup should close when the user clicks the user icon a second time
