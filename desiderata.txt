Desiderata:
- Count of the number of items with each tag (overview view)
- Ability to view multiple tag sets at once (maybe with ctrl + click; if ctrl is down, display both)
- Name of Add tag button in popup needs to change depending on whether you're adding or removing tags
- Tags overview list still isn't sorting correctly (you should just filter the tags into new arrays, and display only those arrays) in order
- Delete tags via right click (both overview and details view)
- Clicking on tag category renders all tags with that category (not just exact matches)
- Character palette
- Notes field on the tag
- Color field on tag
- Ability to rename tags (combine add and delete process)
- Clicking the manage corpora box, then clicking outside of it, seems to reset the workview - stop this behavior
- Hide the results counter when the tagger module is hidden (it displays the last result when the user comes back to it)
- Ability to search for things that *don't* have a particular tag
- Ability to search within results
- Tagger results should not be contentEditable
- Edit tags in place (in the overview pane only)
- Pressing escape when a popup is open should close it
- Order the phrase-level tags alphabetically as well
- Ability to deselect all results
- Create .tagUp() and .tagDown() functions, to apply a tag at one level to every object at the level immediately above/below it
