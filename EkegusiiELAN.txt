0.295	1.583	1.288	§{⟦moganó ngóːchá inde⟧}₴	Is the final /o/ of mogano lengthened? If so, this would be a result of the following NC sequence. There's no initial /o/ on ómogano because the speaker is assuming the role of the story. Very slight pitch uptick and small intensity increase on the /ó/ of mogano. The last two tones are realized mostly as intensity increases rather than pitch. This appears to be how Kennedy made this sound monotone while still imparting tone: It *is* monotone - a nearly flat pitch - but has intensity fluctuations. GM: You usually drop the last sound of the word in elision, but here for some reason we're dropping the first sound of the following word. CGː Sounds like a syllabic /m/, possibly because of an initial downstep.	May I, Story, come?	moganó ngóːchá índe	moɣanó#ŋgóocháá#nde
